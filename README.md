# React/Redux Migration of HabitFract habit tracking application

## This is the second iteration of the frontend for a single-page-application called HabitFract. The original UI was written with the MithrilJS framework, without a global state management library. Some of the features of the original UI (such as a list of habits) are yet to be implemented in this version, as I wanted to focus on a MVP based on 3 hierarchical visualisations using the same data.

## A demo of the UI is live at https://demo.habfract.life

## You can use Redux Devtools to see the state management.
